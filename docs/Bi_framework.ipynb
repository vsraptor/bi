    "REPRESENTATION\n",
    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "I call my atomic structure **Semantic Distributed Pointer (SDP)** (*10_000 bits binary*) to differentiate from Nengo/NEF **SP**. (Still they resemble SP in many ways).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than just calling them **HyperVectors** (as per Kanerva), the name **SDP** more closely describes the use in Bi.. But no worry, both are Ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also to be distinguished by Numenta binary **Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR)**. Which is normaly 2048 bits and is sparse, **SDP** is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus I reserve the right for **SDP** some day to be also real-valued if the need arise ( search : *HRR - Holographic Reduced Representations*, for more info ).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Local vs Distributed\n",
    "----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Information in computers is stored locally, that is, in records with fields.\n",
    "For example let say we want to encode the colors : red, violet, orange and green.\n",
    "If we use local representation we have to use 4 bits, one for each 'feature'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Local representation one unit is used per concept. This is common also in neural nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative is to distribute information from many sources over shared units.\n",
    "Thus our previous color example we could use 2 or 3 bits to represent those colors, using multiple overlapping bits for representing a 'feature'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dense vs Sparse\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation could also be Dense or Sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example Numenta Grok SDR uses 2048 bit binary, 2% sparse representation i.e. 2% of bits are ONE the rest are ZERO.\n",
    "\n",
    "SDP on the other hand are Dense : 10000 bit binary with 50% sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "SDP are sparse in a different sense, they sparsely occupy the space they are allowed to occupy, as you will see in a minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The other feature of vectors which is of utmost importance is the similarity between vectors.\n",
    "Real-valued vectors normally employ geometrical measures like Euclidean distance.\n",
    "In our case we are interested in binary vectors. Here again SDR and SDP differ.\n",

    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Bi** at the base of it all are binary hyper-vectors or in Bi lingo **Semantic Distributed Pointers (SDP)**.\n",
    "In the current implementation an SDP hyper-vector is **10_000** bits binary vector (size can be changed easily, but according to Kanerva that is the optimal size and who m'I to opine).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why binary ?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been pursuing binary approach to machine intelligence for a long time, because it is no brainer.\n",
    "Simplifies implementation and when people finally awake from \"real-valued\" hegemony ;), we will see some tremendous CPU acceleration in MI programs.\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason is that at those sizes we get the required characteristics for doing clever stuff.\n",

    "(If you don't know what orthogonal means, think \"perpendicular\" in 2D space).\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we *randomly create 10_000 bits vector, where every bit has 50/50 chance of being 0 or 1*, we are guaranteed that any time we do that the vector will be orthogonal to all the previously created vectors. Wow, isn't that amazing ?\n",
    "\n",
    "(*Or we can talk about normally distributed real-valued vectors, with 100-300 dimensions : HRR*).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is HUGE, think about that for a minute ?!! \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we create new **SDP** it is guaranteed it will be far away from any previously created one. Perfect for defining new terms (data atoms, symbols), to which we can attach new meaning.\n",

    "Lets do the following thought experiment ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a sphere and you are at the north pole point. If we assign that **point** the meaning of the word \"car\".\n",
    "Closer to the north pole will be points more similar to \"car\". F.e. \"sport car\", \"mazda\", \"blue car\", \"car with 3 wheels\", \"bus\", rather than concepts like \"chair\", \"sky\", \"grass\" or \"computer\" which will be further away.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the points on the sphere will be on the equator i.e. all car-unrelated terms.\n",
    "In fact the points around the equator are **99.XX%** of all the points, that is why they are so orthogonal. But not to worry, even less than 1% of 2^10_000 points is huge number i.e. you can still have billions of them to represent things similar to \"car\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In **10_000** bit space only billionth of the points are within **4700 bits** range and another billionth further than **5300 bit** away i.e. majority of points are between 4700 and 5300 bits hamming distance. (99.7% to be more precise).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make any point/concept your north-pole and you will see the same distribution comparative to this new position.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this metaphor we can see the benefit of highly **orthogonal** spaces. (BTW in reality the space is hypercube).\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the knowledge \"point\" (SDP) is the most basic operation we can do to instantiate new meaning/knowledge/data-point/symbol. It is our starting point from where everything blossoms. At the same time being distributed and large guarantees that it will be noise resistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional programming languages when two pointers point to the same place we say they are identical, but if we change even a single bit they become totally different things, not so with SDP, similar vectors imply similar meanings. The SDP is both the pointer/address and the content/meaning at the same time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Also when we want to peek in those structures because we are dealing with distributed information we have to pry out the constituents.\n",
    "As a result we get noisy vectors like we already saw. We have to cleanup those vectors by comparing them to a memory that holds more pristine representations.\n",

    "The iconic Cleanup memory is Kanerva-SDM (Sparse distributed memory).\n",

    "In the current Bi framework i built more prosaic **CUP** namely a **Lexicon**. Lexicon is a one-to-one cleanup memory, where each data item correspons to a separate-item in the memory. It is not very plausable to how the brain store information, but its simpler implementation allows me to start implementing VSA.\n",

    "**Lexicon** behaves like normal dictionary when accessing symbols (with efficient SDP storage), you give it a symbol name and you get back SDP.\n",

    "**Lexicon** extends that by returning the **symbol name** of the nearest SDP, instead.\n",
    "You can always fetch the SDP by name if you need. The operation I mentioned is called **.best_match()**.\n",
