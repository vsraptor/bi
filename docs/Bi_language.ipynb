    "\n",

    "Then unification is applied which results in **MGU { X : A, B : vader }**.\n",
    "After that the body of the rule is processed from left to right passing and updating the MGU accordingly. Every predicate of the body becomes a sub-goal which follow the same procedure. If all sub-goals succeed the original query succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for some reason sub-goal unification fails the interpreter goes one step back and retries the previous sub-goal again (this is called backtracking), but this time the database-search continues forward from position it reached the last time, not from the beginning. If it reaches the end of the database then the subgoal fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this process the interpreter keeps track of the MGU at every sub-goal in a stack (choice-points) and on retry it restores the MGU replacing the failed-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional complication of the algorithm is the need to localize and un-localize variables, so that the variables are valid only within the clause scope of execution.\n",
    "F.e. the example above the MGU will more correctly be (the one in the curly brackets):\n",

    "If you don't want variable names to \"leak\" and disrupt the unification process you have to localize the variables at entering new clause during execution. It is the same idea in normal languages where variables have a scope of validity.\n",
