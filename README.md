### What is Bi ?

Imagine programming with symbols in language like List or Prolog ... but at the same time those symbols are distributed-vectors, which can be mixed as only vectors can do, but still preserving their symbolic nature. Something like having the whole cake, but eating it too.

> Bi is build on top of the so called VSA (Vector Symbolic Architecture).

As the name implies the symbols are not your run of the mill symbols, but rather vector based i.e. symbolic system based on vector-distributed symbols, instead of traditional approach of using discrete-symbols (where symbols represent entities in all-or-none fashion). VSA approach allows symbols to be compared for similarity.

For more information look in the /docs directory or [Bi](http://ifni.co/bi/TOC.html).

Requires the following modules :

 - bitarray
 - numpy
 - lark
 - lepl !
